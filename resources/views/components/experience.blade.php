So the team lead had an overview about the time that each employee needed for a certain project. It was very fascinating to see the power a software  in relation to cars. Especially how it can help to prevent accidents.</p>

	<p class="col-span-1 sm:col-span-2 pt-2 text-gray-200">At <a href="https://www.frieslandcampina.de/" class="underline"> Friesland Campina</a> I got to know how a food production is organized. One of the most interesting parts were that the machines did most of the job. If there were any error in the machines software, causing a slow down of the production, both the machine operator and the production manager worked hand in hand to solve the problem as quick as possible. Because a production slow down means loosing money. This also made me aware how powerful a software is. To understand the power of software better, I started to learn about programming.</p>
