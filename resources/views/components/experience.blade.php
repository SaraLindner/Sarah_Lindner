	<p class="col-span-1 sm:col-span-2 pt-2 text-gray-200">At <a href="https://www.aboalarm.de/" class="underline">aboalarm</a> I am a contact person for customers needs in first and second level support. If the customers report any problems using the service, I analyze and report it to our IT team. It is very intersting to learn, in which point in the software occurs the problem and how it is fixed. Through this I got to know the way of working of e software developing team.</p>

	<p class="col-span-1 sm:col-span-2 pt-2 text-gray-200">At <a href="https://www.frieslandcampina.de/" class="underline">Friesland Campina</a> a got to know the organisation of a food production. One of the most interesting parts were that the machines did most of the job. If there were any error in the machine software causing a slow down of the production, both the machine operator and the production manager worked hand in hand to solve the problem as quick as possible. Becuase a production slow down means loosing money. This also made me aware how poweful a software is. To understand the power of software better, I started to learn about programming</p>
